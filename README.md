# Welcome to Scuffed Chess!

You have 4 randomly placed figures at your disposal:
- a pawn (p)
- a knight (n)
- a rook (r)
- a king (k)

You can choose them by pressing the keys in parantheses. After choosing a figure you can input the desired move according to these rules:
- pawn: no input necessary, it'll just move forward 1 space

- knight: input a combination of 2 letters from (f - forward b - back l - left r - right) like: fl
          the first letter denotes the direction in which the knight moves 2 spaces and the second
          the direction in which it moves 1 space (note that you can't combine either the same
          direction twice, or two direction that are both vertical or horizontal, like ff, rl, ll, fb

- rook: input f, b, l, r followed by the number of spaces you want to move in that direction

- king: input a number to choose a space to move the king onto.
  The spaces are numbered clockwise staring from the top, like this:  
  8  1  2  
  7  K  3  
  6  5  4  

You can't move onto other pawns, or try to move outside the board,
except for the pawn which will roll back to the bottom after reaching the top
Have fun!
